= Description
   Slicing for Ruby hashes.

= Installation
   gem install hashslice

= Synopsis
   require 'hashslice'

   hash = {'a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3}

   # Slice reference
   hash['a', 'b'] # -> [1, 2]
   hash['a']      # -> 1

   # Slice assignment
   hash['a', 'b'] = 7, 8

   hash # -> {'a' => 7, 'b' => 8, 'c' => 3}
   
   # Sub hash
   hash.hash_of('a', 'b') # -> {'a' => 1, 'b' => 2}

= Overview
   This library modifies the Hash#[] and Hash#[]= methods so that they can
   handle list reference or assignment. It also adds the Hash#hash_of method
   that returns a hash slice.

== Hash#[*keys]
   If more than one key is provided then an array is returned. Single
   keys work as before, i.e. they return a single value.

== Hash#[*keys]=(*values)
   The values on the right are assigned to the keys on left on a one for one
   If there are more values than keys, the extra values are dropped.
